== Workshop overview

This is a quick overview of the workshop goals and what to expect from the lab exercises as you make progress by completing the tasks.

{empty} +

=== Workshop goals

The list below summarises, among others, the main goals the workshop sets for you:

* *Get started with Camel* + 
Understand the basics of Camel and take your first steps. +
{empty} +

* *Be the Camel developer* + 
Experience first hand powerful _Camel_ tooling that accelerates the development process, and how the _Camel DSL_ (Domain Specific Language) helps you defining processing flows. +
{empty} +

* *Understand different levels of control* + 
Familiarise yourself with simple/medium/advanced integrations use cases and how _Camel_ helps to accelerate their delivery. +
{empty} +

* *Evolve an architecture towards maturity* +
Understand the justification behind certain design/architecture principles. Experience hands-on how evolving a platform in the right direction delivers a future proof architecture. +
{empty} +

* *Play with an exciting collaboration use case* + 
Get to know the architecture of a collaboration platform, an increasingly needed capability, strategic for any industry/organisation, to connect internally and externally with colleagues and customers. +
{empty} +

=== Workshop progression

Apache Camel has evolved significantly, with cleaner constructs and a vastly improved developer experience. This delivers two key benefits: simpler usage and long-term maintainability (a big win for seasoned developers), while enabling newcomers to quickly explore its versatility and power.

The workshop takes you on a journey. It starts with simple data flows to show how easy it is and then, step by step, introduces constructs for more complex scenarios.

As you move forward in the workshop, you'll see the solution grow and how to adopt best-practice architectures. Each new case needs more control, an area where experienced *Camel* developers shine.

Every lab step you finish adds real value to the platform being built. The further you go, the more powerful features you uncover. But it all starts with the clean simplicity of no-code building blocks that let anyone set up data flows from A to B.

[time=1]
[id="tech-overview"]
== Technologies overview

If you're unfamilar with Apache Camel, in a nutshell, it is an integration framework to define data flows connecting sources to destinations, applying _EIPs_ (enterprise integration patterns) as transformational processes between the two ends.

The image below illustrates typical integration flows connecting sources to detinations:

image::images/new/camel-nutshell.jpg[align="center", width=60%]

{empty} +

=== Building blocks in Camel

_Apache Camel_ is unique in how you construct data flows and how you extend it by creating customized building blocks.

To help you get familiarized with the different constructs you can use in Camel, the figure below shows a simplified view of how they relate to each other.

image::images/new/camel-abstraction-levels.jpg[align="center", width=60%]

- A pipe is made out of Kamelets
- A Kamelet is the encapsulation of a Camel route
- A Camel route is made out of steps
- A step is tipically a Camel component (but also includes the use of EIPs or calls to other routes or Kamelets).

{empty} +

The workshop will center its attention around those most commonly used: *_Camel routes_* and *_Kamelets_*.

{empty} +

=== Full technology stack

Red Hat® OpenShift® Container Platform, Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation, and Red Hat Application Foundations unlock the potential for agile, scalable integration solutions, enabling seamless orchestration of containerized workflows, resilient data persistence across pipelines, and rapid deployment of event-driven microservices to modernize hybrid cloud architectures with minimal complexity.

* Red Hat Application Foundations

** **Red Hat build of Apache Camel**: A versatile toolkit for streamlined application integration that simplifies and standardizes the practices of connecting diverse systems that runs in both Quarkus and Spring Boot runtimes.

** **Red Hat streams for Apache Kafka**: Based on the Apache Kafka project, streams for Apache Kafka offers a distributed backbone that allows microservices and other applications to share data with extremely high throughput and extremely low latency.

[id="scenario-intro"]
== Scenario introduction

As the internet evolves and technologies and trends emerge, so does the way people and organisations connect. Not only is digitalization transforming and automating processes, but also social changes and events are making an impact that is shaping how we interact.

Email and SMSs started to replace direct phone conversations, and soon instant messaging platforms gained popularity over them. Today we have a big landscape of messaging platforms and often we feel divided on which one to use to communicate with family and friends.

On the professional side, organisations mandate one common communication platform for all associates, but often, more than one survives, splitting work discussions between them.

It becomes even more inconvenient when a sales department, for example, needs to communicate with customers. Telephone / email are old fashioned channels that are no longer effective. Sales agents try to stay in close contact with their customers via instant messaging platforms, and of course, each customer uses a different one.

image::images/scenario-problem.png[align="center", width=40%]

In the picture above, the _Service Agent_ needs to manage multiple and diverse platform accounts in order to stay in contact with different customers.

The workshop proposes to build a platform that addresses this problem. It would integrate all platforms as one, and plug in additional services associated with those interactions. Additionally, the platform would provide new collaboration possibilities and new capabilities to help complying with government regulations, like data privacy and security.

The picture below illustrates a system that integrates all platforms and allows communication exchanges between different members from unrelated entities

image::images/scenario-message-hub.png[align="center", width=40%]

Under such solution, The _Service Agent_ would be abstracted from all external platforms and would simply be another member of the unified platform.

[id='dev-environment']
== Development environment
{style-all}

The following instructions introduce you to your development environment, and the cluster where you'll deploy your applications throughout this workshop.

=== Overview

Built on the open Eclipse Che project, Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces uses Kubernetes and containers to provide any member of the development or IT team with a consistent, secure, and zero-configuration development environment. The experience is as fast and familiar as an integrated development environment on your laptop.

image::images/new/devspaces-ide-developer.jpg[align="center", width=70%]

OpenShift Dev Spaces is included with your OpenShift subscription and is available in the Operator Hub. It provides development teams a faster and more reliable foundation on which to work, and it gives operations centralized control and peace of mind.

=== Tools and components overview

If you haven't recently used _Apache Camel_ or any of the other tools before, it's important you read below all the pieces that are at play, and understand they are conceived to converge into providing a unified development experience.

Below you have a brief introduction to the set of tools and components you're about to use and to help you all along the workshop:

NOTE: It's a long list, but don't worry, the workshop will present them one at a time and guide you on every step of the way.

- *Dev Spaces / VS Code*: the IDE you'll be using to create the _Camel_ processes.
- *Apache Camel*: the integration framework you'll use packed with Enterprise Integration Patterns and Components (connectors).
- *Kaoto*: visual editor for _Apache Camel_ to create your _Camel_ routes and processes in VS Code.
- *Camel JBang*: _Camel_ CLI (command line interface) designed to boost prototyping and accelerate your work to create, test and deploy your applications.
- *Quarkus*: The runtime used by _Camel_ to deploy your integration processes on _OpenShift_
- *OpenShift*: _Kubernetes_ environment where you will deploy your _Camel_ project.
- *OpenShift client*: OpenShift's CLI (command line interface) to help users manage projects in the environment.

{empty} +

=== Java-Lite

One big highlight of the exercises you're about to embark on is that although _Apache Camel_ is _Java_ based, there will be little need in using _Java_, nor having to define or manage dependencies. Those concerns are kept hidden to allow the developer become more productive by focussing on the business case at hand.

NOTE: It goes without saying that at any moment in time _Java_ code can be injected within your _Apache Camel_ processes to incorporate the custom handling you need. _Apache Camel_ excels in this respect thanks to its open framework architecture and extensibility. The workshop will show you a great example of that.
